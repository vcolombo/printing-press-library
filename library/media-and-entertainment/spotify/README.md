# Spotify CLI

**An agent-native Spotify CLI with a SQLite-backed local library that lets you ask listening-drift questions no other Spotify tool can answer.**

Every Spotify Web API endpoint is reachable from one static binary with --json and --select everywhere and a built-in MCP server, so an agent can drive playback, search, and library curation with the same surface a human uses. A local SQLite store captures top-tracks/top-artists snapshots, snapshot-keyed playlist tracks, and extended play history beyond Spotify's 50-event cap, enabling one-shot queries like 'which tracks dropped out of medium-term but stayed in long-term' that no existing CLI can answer. Endpoints Spotify removed for new apps on 2024-11-27 ship as honest deprecation-aware stubs with a --legacy-app opt-in.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `spotify-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-spotify` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install spotify
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install spotify --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install spotify --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install spotify --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install spotify --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/spotify/cmd/spotify-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/spotify-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install spotify --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-spotify --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-spotify --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install spotify --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/spotify-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `SPOTIFY_WEB_OAUTH_2_0` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.


Install the MCP binary from this CLI's published public-library entry or pre-built release.

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spotify": {
      "command": "spotify-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SPOTIFY_WEB_OAUTH_2_0": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

OAuth flows are auto-detected: PKCE is the default when only SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID is set, and Authorization Code with secret is used when SPOTIFY_SECRET is also present; access tokens refresh transparently and rotating refresh tokens are persisted to ~/.config/spotify-pp-cli/token.json.

## Quick Start

```bash
# OAuth PKCE by default; opens a browser and captures the token on a loopback redirect.
spotify-pp-cli auth login

# Confirms the token works and shows display_name, product (premium/free), country.
spotify-pp-cli me

# Verifies the read path works without any user-library scope.
spotify-pp-cli search "never gonna give you up" --type tracks --limit 5

# Shows what's currently playing on which device; foundation for every playback command.
spotify-pp-cli now-playing --json

# Lists active devices so you know which --device id to target for play/transfer.
spotify-pp-cli devices list

# Pulls top tracks (last 6 months) and snapshots them into the local store so drift queries become possible.
spotify-pp-cli top tracks --range medium --limit 20

# Lists your playlists; subsequent playlists tracks <id> calls are snapshot-aware.
spotify-pp-cli playlists list --limit 50

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Playlist maintenance
- **`playlists diff`** — Compare a playlist's current state against any prior snapshot to see exactly which tracks were added, removed, or reordered.

  _Reach for this when a user asks 'what changed in this playlist?' or wants to undo an algorithmic refresh on a collab playlist._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli playlists diff 37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M --against-snapshot abc123 --agent
  ```
- **`playlists dedupe`** — Find duplicate tracks in a playlist by ISRC (catches the album/single/EP/deluxe-reissue dupe class), report by default, --apply to remove.

  _Use this when a curator's playlist has the same recording on three different albums; Spotify's app treats them as distinct._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli playlists dedupe 37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M --by isrc --agent
  ```
- **`playlists merge`** — Combine multiple playlists into one with built-in dedupe and ordering controls.

  _Reach for this when a DJ wants to consolidate retired set playlists into a deep-archive without manually de-duplicating._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli playlists merge 37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M 37i9dQZF1DX0XUsuxWHRQd 6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6 --into <new-playlist-id> --dedupe-by isrc --order by-date
  ```

### Listening drift
- **`top drift`** — Compare two top-tracks snapshots and show who rose, fell, or stayed stable across a time window.

  _Use this when a user asks 'which artists fell off my top-50 between Q1 and Q4?' or wants to track their own listening identity over time._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli top drift --range medium --since 2026-01-01 --agent --select risen,fallen,stable
  ```
- **`releases since`** — List new albums and singles released since a date by artists you follow, sorted newest first.

  _Reach for this when a user asks 'what's new from artists I follow' and the deprecated Release Radar is no longer reachable._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli releases since 2026-05-01 --from followed --agent --select name,artists.0.name,release_date
  ```
- **`play history`** — Bucket your recent play history by the playlist or album that drove each play, ranked by play count and total duration.

  _Reach for this when a DJ asks 'which of my set lists is actually getting played this week' or when a journalist wants column data on listening patterns._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli play history --by context --since 7d --agent --select context_name,play_count,total_duration_min
  ```

### Cross-collection lookup
- **`tracks where`** — For a given track, find every place it appears in your data: which playlists, whether saved, last played, and on which devices.

  _Use this before adding a track to a playlist to avoid duping it, or to answer 'have I played this before' questions._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli tracks where 4uLU6hMCjMI75M1A2tKUQC --agent
  ```

### Agent-native playback
- **`queue from-saved`** — Pick N tracks from your saved library (optionally filtered by artist or playlist origin) and queue them in one command.

  _Use this when an agent should 'queue something from my chillout saved tracks' or 'queue 10 more from this artist' without resorting to URI manipulation._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli queue from-saved --limit 10 --artist 0OdUWJ0sBjDrqHygGUXeCF
  ```

### Music discovery
- **`discover artists`** — Find artists you don't follow yet who match the genres of your top, saved, or followed artists, ranked by popularity within each genre.

  _Reach for this when the user asks 'find me new artists like the ones I already listen to' and the deprecated recommendations endpoint isn't an option._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli discover artists --seed top --exclude-followed --limit 25 --agent --select name,genres,popularity,top_track.name
  ```
- **`discover via-playlists`** — Find artists frequently co-curated with a seed artist by searching public playlists that contain them and ranking other artists by co-occurrence count.

  _Use this for the 'who sounds like X' question Spotify used to answer with related-artists; curator-driven co-occurrence is often a better signal anyway._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli discover via-playlists 0OdUWJ0sBjDrqHygGUXeCF --min-cooccurrence 5 --limit 20 --agent
  ```
- **`discover artist-gaps`** — For an artist, show their full discography chronologically with each album marked as saved or unsaved against your library.

  _Reach for this when a user says 'I love this artist, what have I missed?' — surfaces the gap in their own collection._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli discover artist-gaps 0OdUWJ0sBjDrqHygGUXeCF --show unsaved --include-groups album,single
  ```
- **`discover new-releases`** — Filter Spotify's global new-releases feed down to releases whose artists share a genre with your top or followed artists; optionally exclude artists you already follow.

  _Use this for 'what new music came out this week in genres I actually listen to' — broader than just-from-followed-artists (T5) since it surfaces adjacent artists too._

  ```bash
  spotify-pp-cli discover new-releases --seed-from top --days 14 --exclude-followed --agent --select name,artists.0.name,release_date,genres
  ```

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
spotify-pp-cli audio-analysis mock-value

# JSON for scripting and agents
spotify-pp-cli audio-analysis mock-value --json

# Filter to specific fields
spotify-pp-cli audio-analysis mock-value --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
spotify-pp-cli audio-analysis mock-value --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
spotify-pp-cli audio-analysis mock-value --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Explicit retries** - add `--idempotent` to create retries and `--ignore-missing` to delete retries when a no-op success is acceptable
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - write commands can accept structured input when their help lists `--stdin`
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Health Check

```bash
spotify-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/spotify-web-pp-cli/config.toml`

Static request headers can be configured under `headers`; per-command header overrides take precedence.

Environment variables:

| Name | Kind | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SPOTIFY_WEB_OAUTH_2_0` | per_call | Yes | Set to your API credential. |

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `spotify-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $SPOTIFY_WEB_OAUTH_2_0`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **401 Unauthorized on any command** — Run `spotify-pp-cli auth refresh` to rotate the access token, or `spotify-pp-cli auth login` if the refresh token is also expired.
- **403 PREMIUM_REQUIRED on play / pause / next / seek / volume** — Playback writes require Spotify Premium. Read commands (now-playing, search, playlists) work on free accounts.
- **403 or 404 on audio-features, audio-analysis, recommendations, artists related, playlists featured** — Spotify removed these endpoints for apps created after 2024-11-27. The CLI ships these as honest stubs; pass --legacy-app only if your app has grandfathered extended-quota access. See https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api
- **429 Too Many Requests** — The CLI auto-honors the Retry-After header and backs off with jitter. If you keep hitting it, slow your batch loop or split work across multiple 30-second windows.
- **NO_ACTIVE_DEVICE on play / pause / transfer** — Open Spotify on a phone, desktop, or speaker so a device registers, then retry. Run `spotify-pp-cli devices list` to confirm a device is available and copy its id for --device.
