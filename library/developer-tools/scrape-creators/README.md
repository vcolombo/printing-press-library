# Scrape Creators CLI

**Every Scrape Creators endpoint, plus offline search, cross-platform compounding, and a local store no other Scrape Creators tool ships with.**

Wrap all 114 Scrape Creators endpoints across 23 platforms — TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, Threads, Bluesky, Pinterest, and more — and add a SQLite-backed store with full-text transcript search, cross-platform presence checks, ad-library unified search, and credit-burn projection. Read-only across the board, agent-native by default, every command a typed MCP tool.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `scrape-creators-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-scrape-creators` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and other agents supported by the upstream [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI) in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scrape-creators
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scrape-creators --cli-only
```

For skill only — installs the skill into the same agents as the default command above, but skips the CLI binary (use this to update or reinstall just the skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scrape-creators --skill-only
```

To constrain the skill install to one or more specific agents (repeatable — agent names match the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scrape-creators --agent claude-code
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scrape-creators --agent claude-code --agent codex
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/scrape-creators/cmd/scrape-creators-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/scrape-creators-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

<!-- pp-hermes-install-anchor -->
## Install for Hermes

Install the CLI binary first. The installer writes binaries to a per-user managed bin directory by default: `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows.

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scrape-creators --cli-only
```

Then install the focused Hermes skill.

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-scrape-creators --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-scrape-creators --force
```

Restart the Hermes session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Install for OpenClaw

Install both the CLI binary and the focused OpenClaw skill. The installer defaults binaries to a per-user bin directory (`$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scrape-creators --agent openclaw
```

Restart the OpenClaw session or gateway if the newly installed skill is not visible immediately.

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/scrape-creators-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.
3. Fill in `SCRAPE_CREATORS_API_KEY_AUTH` when Claude Desktop prompts you.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle, install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/scrape-creators/cmd/scrape-creators-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scrape-creators": {
      "command": "scrape-creators-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SCRAPE_CREATORS_API_KEY_AUTH": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Authentication

```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cross-platform compounding
- **`creator find`** — Given a single handle, see which of 11+ platforms the creator is on, with follower counts side-by-side.

  _When an agent needs a creator's full footprint before writing outreach or analysis, this returns it in one call instead of 11._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli creator find mrbeast --json
  ```
- **`trends triangulate`** — Snapshot a hashtag or keyword on TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, and Threads in one call to see which platform it's rising fastest on.

  _Marketers asking 'is this trend cresting on TikTok' can see the answer plus the leading-indicator platform in one command._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli trends triangulate "AI agents" --json
  ```
- **`ads search`** — Search Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn ad libraries in one query — see every ad a brand is currently running.

  _Competitive intel without juggling three vendors and three APIs._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli ads search "Liquid Death" --json
  ```
- **`ads monitor`** — Snapshot a brand's ads on Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn into SQLite; on rerun, diff new ads vs ones that disappeared.

  _Cron-friendly competitive monitoring without glue code._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli ads monitor "Liquid Death" --json
  ```
- **`bio resolve`** — Paste any linktree.ee, komi.io, pillar.io, linkbio, or linkme URL and get the unified destination list.

  _Lead-research tasks that need a creator's full link footprint stop caring which bio service they used._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli bio resolve https://linktr.ee/mrbeast --json
  ```

### Local state that compounds
- **`transcripts search`** — FTS5-indexed search across all transcripts you've synced — TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter videos.

  _Agents doing brand-mention or keyword-monitoring across video content can grep their entire synced corpus offline._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli transcripts search "affiliate link" --json --select creator,platform,snippet
  ```
- **`content spikes`** — Find videos that performed significantly above a creator's average — the ones that actually went viral.

  _When asked 'which videos took off,' the agent can answer with statistical confidence instead of guessing._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli content spikes mrbeast --threshold 2.0 --platform youtube --json
  ```
- **`creator compare`** — Compare two or more creators side-by-side on follower count, engagement rate, posting cadence, and content volume.

  _Influencer-shortlist work that used to take a spreadsheet now takes one command._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli creator compare mrbeast pewdiepie --platform youtube --json
  ```
- **`creator track`** — Snapshot a creator's follower count daily across every platform; chart their growth trajectory over time.

  _Trend lines for momentum decisions (sponsorship, partnership timing)._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli creator track mrbeast --json
  ```
- **`content cadence`** — See when a creator posts — by day of week and hour — across every platform you've synced for them.

  _Benchmark a competitor's publishing strategy or recommend the right slot for a creator partner._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli content cadence mrbeast --platform tiktok --json
  ```
- **`content analyze`** — Rank a creator's synced content by engagement rate (not raw likes) so you see their true best performers.

  _Surfaces over-performers that raw view counts hide._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli content analyze mrbeast --platform youtube --json
  ```
- **`trends delta`** — Track whether a hashtag is growing or shrinking by comparing video counts across snapshot intervals.

  _Distinguish a stable hashtag from a rising or dying one in seconds._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli trends delta "booktok" --days 7 --platform tiktok --json
  ```

### Operator ergonomics
- **`account budget`** — See how fast you're spending API credits and how many days remain at current pace, fused with the API's own usage history.

  _Catches runaway sync jobs before they exhaust the plan._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli account budget --json
  ```

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
scrape-creators-pp-cli account list

# JSON for scripting and agents
scrape-creators-pp-cli account list --json

# Filter to specific fields
scrape-creators-pp-cli account list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
scrape-creators-pp-cli account list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
scrape-creators-pp-cli account list --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Cookbook

### Map a creator's full footprint

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli creator find mrbeast --json --select platform,handle,follower_count
```

Probes every platform's profile endpoint in parallel and returns a presence matrix with follower counts. Useful before writing a brief or outreach email.

### Find a creator's viral hits

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli sync --resources youtube && \
  scrape-creators-pp-cli content spikes mrbeast --threshold 2.0 --platform youtube --json
```

Sync videos to local SQLite, then return videos whose views are more than 2× the creator's average.

### Compare two creators side-by-side

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli creator compare mrbeast pewdiepie --platform youtube --json
```

Pulls each creator's profile from the chosen platform in parallel, computes engagement ratio, and returns one row per creator.

### Track a brand's ad campaigns across networks

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli ads monitor "Liquid Death" --json
```

Snapshots Facebook + Google + LinkedIn ads into SQLite. Rerun on a cron and the command diffs new vs disappeared ads since the last snapshot.

### Triangulate where a trend is rising

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli trends triangulate "AI agents" --json --select per_platform.platform,per_platform.count,per_platform.delta
```

Probes TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, and Threads for a topic in parallel. Returns per-platform velocity — the leading platform pops out when you run it on a cron.

### Watch a hashtag's growth

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli trends delta "booktok" --platform tiktok --days 7 --json
```

Snapshots the current hashtag count and reports the delta vs the most recent prior snapshot in the last 7 days. Schedule on a cron to track growth.

### Grep your transcript corpus

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli transcripts search "affiliate link" --json --select platform,id,snippet
```

FTS5-style search over every transcript synced into the local store — useful for brand-safety audits.

### Resolve a link-in-bio

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli bio resolve https://linktr.ee/mrbeast --json
```

Auto-detects linktree / komi / pillar / linkbio / linkme and returns a unified destination list. Five endpoints unified behind one command.

### Watch your credit budget

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli account budget --days 7 --json
```

Fuses the API's daily-usage history with your remaining credits to project days of runway at the current burn rate.

### Pipe results into jq

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli creator find mrbeast --json | \
  jq '.[] | select(.follower_count > 1000000) | {platform, follower_count}'
```

`--json` returns valid JSON regardless of where stdout is connected; status messages go to stderr so the pipe stays clean.

## Health Check

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/scrape-creators-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:
- `SCRAPE_CREATORS_API_KEY_AUTH`

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `scrape-creators-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $SCRAPE_CREATORS_API_KEY_AUTH`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

### API-specific

- **401 unauthorized** — Set SCRAPE_CREATORS_API_KEY in your environment or run `scrape-creators-pp-cli auth set-token <key>`.
- **Empty result for a profile that should exist** — Some platforms require a username, others a handle prefixed with @, and a few need the numeric ID. Check the command's `--help` for the exact arg shape.
- **Credits running out faster than expected** — Run `scrape-creators-pp-cli account budget --json` — it shows daily spend and projects days remaining.
- **Transcript search returns nothing** — Transcripts must be synced first — run `scrape-creators-pp-cli sync <handle> --platform <p>` and try again.
