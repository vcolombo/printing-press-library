# Scrape Creators — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `scrape-creators-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer. It defaults binaries to `$HOME/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\PrintingPress\bin` on Windows:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press-library install scrape-creators --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `scrape-creators-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure the reported install directory is on `$PATH` for the agent/runtime that will invoke this skill.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.4 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/scrape-creators/cmd/scrape-creators-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI when an agent needs public social-media data across multiple platforms in one invocation, when you need offline search over previously fetched content, or when you want cross-platform compound queries (presence, ads, trends) that no single API call answers. It's read-only — pair it with a posting tool if you need write capability.

## When Not to Use This CLI

Do not activate this CLI for requests that require creating, updating, deleting, publishing, commenting, upvoting, inviting, ordering, sending messages, booking, purchasing, or changing remote state. This printed CLI exposes read-only commands for inspection, export, sync, and analysis.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cross-platform compounding
- **`creator find`** — Given a single handle, see which of 11+ platforms the creator is on, with follower counts side-by-side.

  _When an agent needs a creator's full footprint before writing outreach or analysis, this returns it in one call instead of 11._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli creator find mrbeast --json
  ```
- **`trends triangulate`** — Snapshot a hashtag or keyword on TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, and Threads in one call to see which platform it's rising fastest on.

  _Marketers asking 'is this trend cresting on TikTok' can see the answer plus the leading-indicator platform in one command._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli trends triangulate "AI agents" --json
  ```
- **`ads search`** — Search Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn ad libraries in one query — see every ad a brand is currently running.

  _Competitive intel without juggling three vendors and three APIs._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli ads search "Liquid Death" --json
  ```
- **`ads monitor`** — Snapshot a brand's ads on Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn into SQLite; on rerun, diff new ads vs ones that disappeared.

  _Cron-friendly competitive monitoring without glue code._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli ads monitor "Liquid Death" --json
  ```
- **`bio resolve`** — Paste any linktree.ee, komi.io, pillar.io, linkbio, or linkme URL and get the unified destination list.

  _Lead-research tasks that need a creator's full link footprint stop caring which bio service they used._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli bio resolve https://linktr.ee/mrbeast --json
  ```

### Local state that compounds
- **`transcripts search`** — FTS5-indexed search across all transcripts you've synced — TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter videos.

  _Agents doing brand-mention or keyword-monitoring across video content can grep their entire synced corpus offline._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli transcripts search "affiliate link" --json --select creator,platform,snippet
  ```
- **`content spikes`** — Find videos that performed significantly above a creator's average — the ones that actually went viral.

  _When asked 'which videos took off,' the agent can answer with statistical confidence instead of guessing._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli content spikes mrbeast --threshold 2.0 --platform youtube --json
  ```
- **`creator compare`** — Compare two or more creators side-by-side on follower count, engagement rate, posting cadence, and content volume.

  _Influencer-shortlist work that used to take a spreadsheet now takes one command._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli creator compare mrbeast pewdiepie --platform youtube --json
  ```
- **`creator track`** — Snapshot a creator's follower count daily across every platform; chart their growth trajectory over time.

  _Trend lines for momentum decisions (sponsorship, partnership timing)._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli creator track mrbeast --json
  ```
- **`content cadence`** — See when a creator posts — by day of week and hour — across every platform you've synced for them.

  _Benchmark a competitor's publishing strategy or recommend the right slot for a creator partner._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli content cadence mrbeast --platform tiktok --json
  ```
- **`content analyze`** — Rank a creator's synced content by engagement rate (not raw likes) so you see their true best performers.

  _Surfaces over-performers that raw view counts hide._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli content analyze mrbeast --platform youtube --json
  ```
- **`trends delta`** — Track whether a hashtag is growing or shrinking by comparing video counts across snapshot intervals.

  _Distinguish a stable hashtag from a rising or dying one in seconds._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli trends delta "booktok" --days 7 --platform tiktok --json
  ```

### Operator ergonomics
- **`account budget`** — See how fast you're spending API credits and how many days remain at current pace, fused with the API's own usage history.

  _Catches runaway sync jobs before they exhaust the plan._

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli account budget --json
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Map a creator's full footprint

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli creator find mrbeast --json --select platform,handle,follower_count
```

Probes every platform's profile endpoint and returns a presence matrix with follower counts. Useful before writing a brief or outreach email.

### Find a creator's viral hits

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli sync --resources youtube && scrape-creators-pp-cli content spikes mrbeast --threshold 2.0 --platform youtube --json
```

Sync videos to local SQLite, then return videos whose engagement is more than 2× the creator's average.

### Track a brand's ad campaigns across networks

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli ads monitor "Liquid Death" --json
```

Snapshots Facebook + Google + LinkedIn ads into SQLite; rerun on a cron and diff new vs disappeared.

### Triangulate where a trend is rising

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli trends triangulate "AI agents" --json --select platform,result_count,delta_pct
```

Probes TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, and Threads for a topic and returns per-platform velocity. Reads the leading platform when run repeatedly.

### Grep your transcript corpus

```bash
scrape-creators-pp-cli transcripts search "affiliate link" --json --select creator,platform,video_url,snippet
```

FTS5 over every transcript you've synced, returning the creator/platform/URL/match — useful for brand-safety audits.

## Auth Setup

Set SCRAPE_CREATORS_API_KEY (get one at https://scrapecreators.com). One header, no OAuth handshake.

Run `scrape-creators-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  scrape-creators-pp-cli account list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Read-only** — do not use this CLI for create, update, delete, publish, comment, upvote, invite, order, send, or other mutating requests

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
scrape-creators-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
scrape-creators-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
scrape-creators-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.scrape-creators-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `SCRAPE_CREATORS_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `SCRAPE_CREATORS_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
scrape-creators-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
scrape-creators-pp-cli --profile briefing account list
scrape-creators-pp-cli profile list --json
scrape-creators-pp-cli profile show briefing
scrape-creators-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `scrape-creators-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)
## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/scrape-creators/cmd/scrape-creators-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add scrape-creators-pp-mcp -- scrape-creators-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which scrape-creators-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   scrape-creators-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `scrape-creators-pp-cli <command> --help`.
